# Task-Cli
This is a simple command-line interface (CLI) task manager built with Node.js. It allows users to create, update, delete, and manage tasks directly from the terminal. Tasks are stored persistently in a JSON file on the local filesystem, enabling users to keep track of their to-dos easily without the need for any external database.
